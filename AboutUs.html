                        <p> Over the last few decades, our society has undergone revolutionary changes in technology, industry, and politics, but women are still fighting for their rights. People's misogynistic thinking desperately consumes the privileges of women. Not only has modern society failed to serve established women's rights, but it has made it much more difficult for women to survive because of their safety. Violence against Pakistani women is constantly increasing.
                            Pakistan is ranked 153rd out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index 2021. In South Asia, it ranks 7th out of 8 countries. The COVID19 embargo increased domestic violence by 25 percent. Pakistan received nearly 10,000 complaints of violence and abuse against women this year in Sindh alone, according to local media reports. According to Geographic News in Hyderabad, Pakistan, a total of 6,325 cases of women's rights infringement have been recorded since 2018. This year, Punjab female helplines received 4,649 complaints, according to Federal Human Rights statistics. Pakistan is the sixth most dangerous country for women, according to a 2018 survey by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
                            In an era where the security of such important personalities in society is ignored, we develop smart two-way electronic gadgets that are used to immediately rescue victims in the event of danger and record. Evidence that women want to strengthen and recover their integrity. Further development of the system is fully automated, allowing victims to influence specific situations by recognizing anomalies and triggering emergency calls to their respective authorities.
                            The motivation for this project is to empower women in all areas of our society.The fabricated wearable will strengthen a wide spectrum of women as well as increase awareness.
                            The project's architecture first standardizes the integration of wearable into mobile app. The collected data will be further analyzed to detect variability Observation of victim's heart rate, palpitations abnormalities, Confirmation alerts are generated and confirmed by constant surveillance, so the appropriate action is taken only in an emergency. Then send the alarm to the specified contact. In such a situation, the recorder and camera will automatically turn on to get the definitive proof.
                            Empowering women in the respective domain would encourage the victims to be more vocally sound and fight on the front foot and take action against perpetrators who are constantly abusing women.
