        <p class="TOU">Over the last few decades, our society has undergone revolutionary changes in technology, industry, and politics, but women are still fighting for their rights. People’s
            misogynistic thinking desperately consumes the privileges of women. Not only has
            modern society failed to serve established women’s rights, but it has made it much
            more difficult for women to survive because of their safety. Violence against Pakistani women is constantly increasing.
            Pakistan is ranked 153rd out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s
            Global Gender Gap Index 2021. In South Asia, it ranks 7th out of 8 countries.
            The COVID19 embargo increased domestic violence by 25 percent. Pakistan received nearly 10,000 complaints of violence and abuse against women this year in
            Sindh alone, according to local media reports. According to Geographic News in Hyderabad, Pakistan, a total of 6,325 cases of women’s rights infringement have been
            recorded since 2018. This year, Punjab female helplines received 4,649 complaints,
            according to Federal Human Rights statistics. Pakistan is the sixth most dangerous
            country for women, according to a 2018 survey by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
            In an era where the security of such important personalities in society is ignored,
            we develop smart two-way electronic gadgets that are used to immediately rescue
            victims in the event of danger and record. Evidence that women want to strengthen
            1
            and recover their integrity. Further development of the system is fully automated,
            allowing victims to influence specific situations by recognizing anomalies and triggering emergency calls to their respective authorities.
            The motivation for this project is to empower women in all areas of our society.The fabricated wearable will strengthen a wide spectrum of women as well as
            increase awareness.
            The project’s architecture first standardizes the integration of wearable into mobile app. The collected data will be further analyzed to detect variability Observation of victim’s heart rate, palpitations abnormalities, Confirmation alerts are generated and confirmed by constant surveillance, so the appropriate action is taken
            only in an emergency. Then send the alarm to the specified contact. In such a
            situation, the recorder and camera will automatically turn on to get the definitive
            proof.
            Empowering women in the respective domain would encourage the victims to be
            more vocally sound and fight on the front foot and take action against perpetrators
            who are constantly abusing women.
            There are limited studies and discoveries aimed at overcoming atrocities against women. Out-of-the-box advances require human intervention in the device, or elaborate research to resolve the safety of suspicious females is considerable in unique 
            situations. Some invented handheld devices are portable but are complex or incapable of functioning while the victim is immobile. However, there are some practical
devices that require fingerprint authentication. This is not very practical given the
situation and may not require variations in lighting sides, head posture, and obstruction. [1] demonstrates a functional 2-way women safety system, it comprises
of an alert system using a button/fingerprint scanner planted on a handbag when
under perilous circumstances it will automatically generate an alert and send it to
the authorities with the victim’s location. Whereas this respective design provides
a safety system but it is quite bulky and arduous keeping in mind the situation the
victim is involved in. Therefore we have formulated a much convenient and automated system for the given circumstances.
Whereas [2] exhibits a prototype alongside a mobile application that contains
functionalities of sending an emergency SOS both manually and by pressing the
volume button. The hardware is activated using a button, which sends an alert
accompanied by the location when in distress.

However, there are various akin examples but they are all user reliant. [3] states
the response of the human body under the influence of fear and anxiety. The inceptive reflexes of a human during fear are pupil dilation, increased heart rate, and
oxygen levels. We have formulated a fully automated device with would sense the
pulses every couple of seconds, process the data, and in case of any detected abnormality it generate an emergency SOS alongside the victim’s location for immediate
rescue.
